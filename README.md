# Web Search Tool Calling In AI Chatbots

This repository studies how modern AI chatbots decide to call Web search tools and how those calls shape the final response.

## Motivation

1. AI agents powering chatbots are increasingly relying on tools, particularly Web search.
2. Web search is a complex task:
   - deciding when parametric knowledge is enough vs. when a tool should be called,
   - formulating search queries from user intent,
   - reformulating queries as new evidence is retrieved,
   - generating final responses grounded in both model knowledge and retrieved results.
3. We analyze longitudinal data from four popular chatbot platforms:
   - ChatGPT
   - Grok
   - Claude
   - DeepSeek
4. Implications:
   - (a) designers of AI agents,
   - (b) designers of Web search tools for AI agents,
   - (c) end users of chat platforms.

## Repository Layout

- `src/web_tool_invocation.py`: analyses focused on Web-call decisions and trends.
- `src/query_reformulations.py`: query evolution and reformulation analyses.
- `src/source_selection.py`: retrieved/cited source analyses.
- `src/response_generation.py`: response grounding and quality analyses.
- `outputs/`: generated analysis artifacts.

## Setup

This project uses Python and common data-science dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dummy Dataset For Development

To support testing and later pipeline stages without full raw exports, a dummy dataset is included.

You can load the dummy dataset with the helper in `src/data_extraction.py`:

```python
from data_extraction import load_whole_data_from_file, load_web_data_from_file

df = load_whole_data_from_file("csv")
web_df = load_web_data_from_file("csv")
```

## Notes

- Raw data paths in some scripts are machine-specific and may require local edits.
- Analysis outputs are written under `outputs/` by default.
